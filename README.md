# 🏥 Hospital Management System - C++ (Data Structures)

This is a console-based **Hospital Management System** developed in **C++**, using custom data structures (specifically, singly linked lists). It allows managing patient information including adding, deleting, searching, and editing patient records.

---

## 📌 Features

- ➕ Add new patients to the hospital database
- ❌ Delete a patient record by position
- 🔍 Search for a patient by name
- 🧾 View all patient records in the linked list
- 🔄 Update a patient’s name
- 🔢 View the number of patients in the hospital
- 🔼 Insert a new patient at the front of the list

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

- **Singly Linked List**
  - Each `Node` contains a `Data` object (patient info) and a pointer to the next node.
  - Custom functions are implemented to insert, delete, update, and traverse nodes.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User is presented with a menu:
   - 1: Add patient
   - 2: Delete patient
   - 3: Search by name
   - 4: Count number of patients
   - 5: Display all records
   - 6: Change patient name
   - 7: Insert at front
2. Based on input, corresponding data structure operations are performed on the linked list.
3. Input is handled interactively via the console.

## 📦 Sample Input Flow

```bash
CTRL + Z to exit
1 - Add Patient
2 - Delete Patient
3 - Search by Name
4 - List Length
